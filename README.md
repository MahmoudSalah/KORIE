# KORIE
KORIE: A Multi-Task Benchmark for Detection, OCR, and IE on Korean Retail Receipts

KORIE is an **actively expanding dataset**.  
The current release includes **674 Korean retail receipts**, consisting of both flatbed-scanned and mobile-captured images. However, this dataset is not static. We are continuously adding new receipts to increase diversity in:

- Store types (restaurants, supermarkets, convenience stores, retail chains, etc.)
- Geographic regions across South Korea
- Receipt layouts, fonts, and thermal-printing variations
- Real-world imaging conditions (blur, glare, shadows, skew, and perspective distortion)

Each new batch of receipts undergoes the same annotation and verification pipeline used for the initial release.

### 🔄 Version Updates
Future versions of KORIE will be released in this repository and may include:
- Additional images and bounding-box annotations  
- More OCR crops and transcriptions  
- Expanded item-level and field-level IE labels  
- Updated train/val/test splits  
- A changelog describing all modifications

We encourage researchers to periodically check this repository for the latest version, as KORIE is intended to grow into a larger, more comprehensive benchmark for Korean receipt understanding.
